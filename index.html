                                Elden Ring, developed by FromSoftware in collaboration with George RR Martin is their venture into open world setting for the first time. Several of their masterful entries like the Dark Souls franchise, Bloodborne and Sekiro have culminated together in order to create the perfectly crafted gameplay in Elden Ring. Unlike in traditional open world games where the player is guided through the help of map markers or waypoints, Elden Ring takes a different approach, where the player is thrust into the open world with little instructions while the game guides them subtly into various locations. This creates a very unique sense of exploration as the player doesn't feel hand holded by the game and their exploration is also rewarded with unique weapons, armor, incantations and other assortments that would help them in their journey through the Lands Between.

                                The Lands Between is the world of Elden Ring, and to those who live in The Lands Between were blessed by the Elden Ring and the "Erdtree". Those who were blessed by the Elden Ring are characterized by having a golden aura that can be seen in their eyes. However, at some point, some of those who were blessed, lost their grace, was exiled and labeled as the Tarnished.  As time passed, for unknown reasons, the Elden Ring was shattered across the lands and its pieces were picked up by many of the 6 demigods, where they inherited different powers and have physically changed and twisted due to being corrupted by the power.

                                In the official reveal trailer that was presented in E3 2021, you'll see a softly spoken, hooded woman saying "The Tarnished, will soon return." The question is, who and what is The Tarnished? Simple, The Tarnished is you, the player, you are one of the Tarnished that have been exiled upon losing their blessing that was given by the Elden Ring and the "Erdtree", a tree that hosts source and life of The Lands Between. Very much like previous Souls games, you are the chosen undead or the ashen one. You are then called back to The Lands Between, as well as the other Tarnished after the destruction of the Elden Ring to recover the shards of the Elden Ring, to make them whole once again, and to become the lord of The Lands Between.

                                The Lands Between is broken into 6 distinct areas that is overseen by a demigod and features a central hub that connects all these 6 areas. According to an interview with Miyazaki, players will have total freedom as to the order they want to tackle for each area, and it is up to the player on how they want to approach it. Apart from that the hub will not be accessible at the beginning of the game, which means you will need to progress the game until you reach the hub area.

                                According to Hidetaka Miyazaki in an interview: " I feel like one of the main themes of the game is how the player, the Tarnished, approaches or treats this new-found grace and this return to the land that they were once banished from, how they interpret this and the meaning. It's not just the player-character, of course, it's lots of characters in the game, who are all beckoned back and will have their own adventures and motives. We want the player to discover for themselves what that means and how they want to begin their adventure."

                                Stealth mechanics seem that will be present and may be useful in combination with backstab attacks, also the game may feature a night and day mechanic that may affect the stealth mechanic as well. Stealth as many are aware of, will allow the player to crouch, sneak, and hide behind tall grass to be less detected by the enemy. Stealth will play an integral mechanic in combat since you can use it to your advantage to sneak behind an enemy to instantly kill them or at least deal a large amount of damage from using a stealth attack.

                                Elden Ring will have a large scale in terms of the world and exploration, and to go hand-in-hand with this, some new mechanics are introduced such as jumping, yes players can jump now, as well as riding on horseback (Mounts). Hidetaka Miyazaki strongly suggests that you thoroughly search and explore every section of the world to find Skills that are hidden. There are a number of choices as well that players can approach their way of combat, some may be brave and choose to go on head-to-head, while others would rather have allies such as being able to summon the spirits of deceased enemies.

                                In the trailer that was revealed in E3 2021, we see a lot of unique Skills, magical abilities, and even having a horse leaping up a cliffisde, as well as attacking while riding your Mount. These are Skills that you pick up through the player's progression and exploration. There are some cases that a player can acquire a skill through purchasing it from merchants or learning them from an NPC, but during an interview with Hidetaka Miyazaki that was featured, he stresses out that in general, skils are hidden throughout the game's world, and it is the player's responsibiility to discover these through exploration.

                                One of the combat aspects of Elden Ring is being able to summon Spirits that can help you in battle. These spirits are usually the fallen souls of the enmies that you defeat, and summoning them will have them assist you in combat. These are your offline summons, and it is quite different to have your friends or other playres summoned to your session which is available in Online co-op play. What's interesting with multiplayer is that you can even set a password on your calling marks, so that this way you can just have your friends join your session, if you're more comfortable with that rather than having a random drop in.

                                Elden Ring will have complete freedom when it comes to building up your character, you are basically free to combine your Skills with different weapons and equipment, and you'll learn magic as well. Skills are freely interchangeable between a large variety of weapons as per Hidetaka Miyazaki, and that there are around 100 Skills. With having less restrictions, players will have even more variations of Builds that is even richer than previous Souls games.

                                Accorting to Miyazaki, "|These spirit summons, we feel like – as well as there being a large variety to them – they're a nice collectable hidden element within the game world to discover and to equip as you go. They offer a lot of different strategic options, but also the player might find that they just like a certain enemy tagging along with them, a certain summon pleases them aesthetically. So there's a lot of strategic and a lot of personal touch to these summons. And we hope that players will also enjoy discovering their own progression elements as well."

                                Real-time changes are featured in Elden Ring in the form of the Day and Night cycle, as well as Dynamic Weather. These features also heavily affect gameplay, combat, and the world you are exploring. For example, in cases that you are romaing at night, both players and enemies will change in terms of aggression due to a decrease in visibility, and some special enemies that only appear at night will come out.

                                There will only be ONE difficulty in Elden Ring. The decision of FromSoftware leaning towards this feature can benefit both new and veteran players of this genre. Elden Ring features a large scale when it comes to its world and exploration, so it does make sense that it really is up to you on how you want to tackle the game, it is highly encouraged that players carefully assess the situation that lies ahead and to find different ways to deal with it. This also provides a good camaraderie within the community since everyone can share their experiences and hopefully help one another.
